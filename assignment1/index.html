    <h1>Interactive Media</h1>
    <h2>A case study of alann.com</h2>
</body>
<h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
<p>The first element I paid attention to on the webpage when interacting was the flipping head image in the centre of the page. This motion told me that the webpage was loading and I needed to wait until the page was fully loaded. After that the page faded into a figure holding a cup of coffee with a start buttle showing on its chest leading the viewer to click it. </p>
<h3>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
<p>The main interaction of the webpage is scrolling and clicking. The webpage prompts the user to complete the action by giving notices such as ‘please scroll’ and arrows pointing downwards. The site contains clicking on certain elements for the viewer to read more about the designer. This is shown by the size of the element changes when the mouse hovers over it with the showing up of the speech bubbles. </p>
<h3>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
<p>The experience that I spend the most time engaging with the scrolling. As I scroll down the page some animations are shown and they are interesting to watch. The animations also helped me to navigate through the site. </p>
<h3>What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
<p>The most common action during the two-minute interaction is scrolling. During the interaction I realised that the scrolling action is not as smooth and quick as other websites, I usually need to wait 1 to 2 seconds for the site to scroll down to the next section. The delay confuses me as I thought it was a problem with my laptop. However, scrolling becomes smoother as I enter the About and Discovery pages. </p>
<h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
<p>My impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience is straightforward. The webpage layout is clean so I know where to click or scroll for more information. The site navigates me step by step and shows me everything in neat order, instead of me clicking everywhere and don’t know if l should click or scroll.</p>
<h3>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
<p>The site is a portfolio of the designer, he uses it to show his experience, ability and work to his possible customers. The site is straightforward in that it is a portfolio with the minimum text that helps the viewer to quickly scroll through and know everything about him. </p>
