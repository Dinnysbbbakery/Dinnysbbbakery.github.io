    <h1>INTERACTIVE MEDIA RESEARCH PROJECT</h1>
    <h2>CASE STUDY: ALANNN.COM</h2>
</div>
<main>
<div class="box1">
    <h3>1)  What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
    <p>The first element I paid attention to on the webpage when interacting was the flipping head 
        image in the centre of the page. This motion told me that the webpage was loading and I needed 
        to wait until the page was fully loaded. After that the page faded into a figure holding a cup 
        of coffee with a start buttle showing on its chest leading the viewer to click it. </p>
</div>

<div class="box2">
    <h3>2)  Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
    <p>The main interaction of the webpage is scrolling and clicking. The webpage prompts the user to 
        complete the action by giving notices such as ‘please scroll’ and arrows pointing downwards. 
        The site contains clicking on certain elements for the viewer to read more about the designer. 
        This is shown by the size of the element changes when the mouse hovers over it with the showing up of the speech bubbles. </p>
</div>

<div class="box3">
    <h3>3)  What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
    <p>The experience that I spend the most time engaging with the scrolling. As I scroll down the page some
        animations are shown and they are interesting to watch. The animations also helped me to navigate through the site. </p>
</div>

<div class="box4">
    <h3> 
        4)  What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
    <p>The most common action during the two-minute interaction is scrolling. During the interaction I realised 
    that the scrolling action is not as smooth and quick as other websites, I usually need to wait 1 to 2 seconds 
    for the site to scroll down to the next section. The delay confuses me as I thought it was a problem with my laptop. 
    However, scrolling becomes smoother as I enter the About and Discovery pages. </p>
</div>

<div class="box5">
    <h3>5)  What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
    <p>My impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience is straightforward. The webpage 
        layout is clean so I know where to click or scroll for more information. The site navigates me step by 
        step and shows me everything in neat order, instead of me clicking everywhere and don’t know if l should click or scroll.</p>
</div>

<div class="box6">
    <h3>6)  How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
    <p>The site is a portfolio of the designer, he uses it to show his experience, ability and work to his possible 
        customers. The site is straightforward in that it is a portfolio with the minimum text that helps the viewer 
        to quickly scroll through and know everything about him. </p>
</div>
<div class="box7">
    <h3>7)  What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? 
        (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
    <p>The speech bubbles appear after every figure to help viewers to know what they are 
        clicking into, also the dialogue effect gives the viewer a friendly impression of 
        the designer.</p>
</div>
<div class="box8">
    <h3>8)  How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with 
        over time?</h3>
        <p>Some elements on the page change sizes or appear on the page as the viewer moves 
            their mouse around. This gives the viewers visual prompts of where to click and 
            what information they will give when they click on the next page. The site also 
            returns back to the top of the page if the viewer tries to scroll more at the end 
            of the site to notify them there is no more new information.</p>
</div>
<div class="box9">
    <h3>9)  What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
    <p>The site uses simple illustrations and elements that are related to his job to reinforce
         what the designer is doing. The designer uses a large amount of visuals instead of 
         texts to introduce himself such as different program logos were used too to show what
          skills the designer has. </p>
</div>
<div class="box10">
    <h3>10)  What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging 
        with your research experience?</h3>
        <p>These references allow the viewers to skim through the site without missing any 
            important information as this site acts like a resume for some of his potential 
            customers who may not have much time to read in detail. Using visuals is the most
             effective way to advertise himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="box11">
    <h3>11)  What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging 
        with your research experience?</h3>
        <p>These references allow the viewers to feel the creator is a skilled web developer as the 
            site itself already demonstrates the skills he has and how well he fits into the role. </p>
</div>
<div class="box12">
    <h3>12)  What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
    <p>The most frustrating part of the interaction for me was scrolling on the main site. The 
        scrolling action is delayed and is not sensitive, there was a 1 to 3 seconds wait after 
        each scroll action. There were also times when the site scrolled the wrong way which caused
         more time wasted. </p>
</div>
<div class="box13">
    <h3>13)  What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>
    <p>The most satisfying part of the interaction for me is the grey fly next to the mouse. 
        It follows the navigation of the mouse, and the moving graphic contrasts with the other
         still elements which makes it fun to look at.</p>
